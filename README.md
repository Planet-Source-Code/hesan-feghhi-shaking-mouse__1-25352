## SHAKING MOUSE \!\!


</div>

### Description

A teasing program, your mouse shakes and you can't do anything. The only way to escape is to click on a button. But the button escapes from you and there is no way to get it! Could you find another way? Yeah!! There is a hidden button in the right-bottom of the screen. Move the mouse around there to find it. If you like this teasing virus, vote for it!
